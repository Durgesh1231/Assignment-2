    " a) explicit function - In Explicit Type Conversion in Python, the data type is manually changed by the user as per their requirement.\n",
    "    eg. 1.int(a, base): This function converts any data type to integer. ‘Base’ specifies the base in which string is if the data type is a string.\n",
